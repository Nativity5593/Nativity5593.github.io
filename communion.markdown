We offer Holy Communion most Sundays during service.

We welcome all to Holy Communion who are baptized, and who believe Jesus Christ is their Lord and Savior.

Youth who are in second grade and above, and have completed Early Communion ​instruction are also invited to Holy Communion.

_Anyone_ can come forward for a blessing by presenting crossed arms over his or her chest.

(The cups in the center of the tray contain grape juice for those not wanting wine.) 

_“Come receive the strength and fullness of our Heavenly Father’s love.”_
